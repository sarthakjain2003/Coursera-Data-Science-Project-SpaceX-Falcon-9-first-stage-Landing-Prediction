## Result

### Findings from Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): 
As more rockets are launched, success rate improves (flight number and success rate positively correlated).

ES-L1, GEO, HEO, and SSO orbits had the highest success rates (100%). 

Success rates improved from 2013-2020, from 0% to ~80%. 

### Findings from Proximities Analysis: 
Launch sites are in the southern United States, as near the equator as practical.

Launch sites are near the coast and a major highway or railroad. 

### From Predictive Analysis: 
Decision Tree Classification scored the best, but all four models performed similarly well.

All models experienced Type I errors, which is the less desirable error and can result in underestimate costs. 

As new data is available, using it to train/test the data should improve results.
